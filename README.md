# Customer Churn Analysis

## Final Findings & Business Recommendations

### Objective:
Analyze customer churn to identify key drivers and provide actionable strategies for improving customer retention.

### Key Insights:
- Customers with low transaction count (< 50) and inactivity of 0, 3, or 4 months had higher churn rates.
- Platinum and Gold card holders showed significantly higher churn than Silver and Blue users.
- Surprisingly, customers with higher education levels churned more than those with lower qualifications.
- Customers earning < $40K and > $120K showed the highest churn rates.
- Higher utilization ratio is directly correlated with increased churn.
- The 40–60 age group experienced more churn than other age bands.
- Customers with longer tenure and higher contact frequency were more likely to churn — indicating potential dissatisfaction despite engagement.
- Single, Divorced, and Unknown marital status customers had higher churn compared to Married customers.

### Business Recommendations:
- Increase engagement campaigns for low-transaction customers and Platinum/Gold card holders (e.g., cashback, discounts).
- Reward loyalty — provide perks for long-tenured and high-transaction customers.
- Consider reducing annual charges and interest rates for low-income customers to improve retention.
- Collect and analyze feedback from churned customers to identify unresolved pain points.
- Improve support response time — resolve issues proactively to retain high-risk users.

### Project Summary:
- Cleaned and analyzed 10,000+ records
- Built insightful visualizations with Seaborn & Matplotlib
